# GitHub Actions OpenGame Runtime Migration

## Problem

Vercel Sandbox returns HTTP 402 in production and E2B API key creation is blocked by payment verification. The MVP still needs a real OpenGame runtime, browser validation, Blob upload, and database status updates without adding a paid sandbox dependency.

## Decision

Use GitHub Actions as the default low-frequency generation worker.

- Vercel keeps serving the Next.js app, gallery, create flow, and polling APIs.
- `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=github` makes the app queue a GitHub-backed job. In Vercel production, `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` triggers `.github/workflows/opengame-generate.yml` immediately; without it, the scheduled workflow polls queued jobs every five minutes. In local development, the Next.js server starts a local GitHub-compatible worker automatically so localhost jobs do not wait for remote GitHub Actions.
- The workflow runs `scripts/run-github-opengame-job.ts`, installs OpenGame in the runner, generates the HTML5 game, and runs the same headless Chromium playability validator. The runner does not store production secrets; it calls Vercel `/api/github-worker/*` endpoints so MiniMax, Blob upload, and Prisma writes stay on Vercel.
- Existing Vercel Sandbox and E2B code remains as compatibility paths for future paid/provisioned runtimes.

## Data Flow

1. User confirms a game brief.
2. The app creates a `Job` with `QUEUED` status and stores prompt metadata.
3. Production Vercel dispatches the GitHub Actions workflow with `job_id`, or the scheduled workflow picks up the oldest queued GitHub job. Local development starts `scripts/run-github-opengame-job.ts` as a child process against `APP_BASE_URL`.
4. The GitHub runner or local compatible worker claims the job through `/api/github-worker/jobs/claim`, updates `Job.log` and `Job.status` through the app, and runs OpenGame.
5. The worker validates playability, posts generated files back to the app, and the app uploads to Blob, updates the `Game` to `READY`, and marks the job `DONE`.
6. The frontend keeps polling `/api/jobs/:id/progress`; it now reads database-backed progress for GitHub jobs.

## User Impact

- Generation becomes slower than an always-on sandbox because each job waits for a GitHub runner and cold-installs OpenGame.
- The UX remains the same: create, watch progress, then play from the detail page.
- For a 10-20 person internal MVP, GitHub Actions free minutes are a better fit than forcing a paid sandbox provider.

## Required Configuration

Vercel environment variables:

- `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=github`
- `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` for production immediate `workflow_dispatch`; without it Vercel can only wait for the scheduled poller. Use a fine-grained GitHub token when possible, limited to `zhang1590424-rgb/opengame-astrocade-mvp` with `Actions: Read and write`.
- `GITHUB_DISPATCH_REPO=zhang1590424-rgb/opengame-astrocade-mvp`
- `GITHUB_DISPATCH_WORKFLOW=opengame-generate.yml`
- `GITHUB_DISPATCH_REF=main`

Local development variables:

- `APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` by default; the local worker uses it to call `/api/github-worker/*`.
- Optional `DISABLE_LOCAL_GITHUB_WORKER=1` keeps jobs queued for manual worker debugging.
- Optional `FORCE_GITHUB_DISPATCH=1` makes local development dispatch the remote GitHub workflow, which is only useful when `APP_BASE_URL` is reachable by GitHub Actions.

GitHub repository variables:

- Optional: `APP_BASE_URL`
- Optional: `MINIMAX_TEXT_MODEL`
- Optional: `OPENGAME_GIT_URL`

## Validation

Local validation remains:

- `npx prisma generate`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Start `npm run dev`, create a game locally, and confirm the log moves from local queueing into `RUNNING` / `VALIDATING` / `READY` without manually starting a worker.

True smoke validation requires the workflow file to be pushed and the Vercel/GitHub secrets above to be configured, then creating one minimal game from the production UI.

## Production Status on 2026-05-10

Production alias:

- `https://opengame.zz-fancy.cloud`

Deployment and configuration:

- Vercel Production has `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` configured as an encrypted environment variable.
- A production redeploy was completed after adding the variable, so Serverless Functions read the new value.
- New generation jobs now log `Queued GitHub Actions workflow opengame-generate.yml on zhang1590424-rgb/opengame-astrocade-mvp@main.` instead of the scheduled-worker fallback.
